# Data Analytics Project
This Data Analytics Project exhibits a multitude of analyses as it relates to video game sales ranging from 1985-2016. Throughout this project you will learn about the measures of central tendencies, variances, popularity, correlations, and more, related to video game sales in the specified time period!

This project is coded in a Jupyter Notebook in which each cell can be ran individually after all cells are run in sequential order. This can be done by pressing the "Run All" command at the top of the file. After each cell is intially ran the results of each cell can be viewed.

Cells can be ran individually by hovering over each cell then clicking the play button in the top left corner. Once a green check displays in the bottom left corner, the cell has completed running.
