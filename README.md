# Data Analytics Project
This project is coded in a Jupyter Notebook in which each kernal can be ran individually after all kernals are ran in sequential order. This can be done by pressing the "Run All" command at the top of the file. After each kernal is intially ran the results of each kernal can be viewed.

Run the kernals individually by hovering over each kernal then clicking the play button in the top left corner. Once a green check displays in the bottom left corner, the kernal has completed running.
